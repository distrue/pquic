 * 
 * Queue using two pointers, head and tail, and a simple linked list
 * to the next element being removed. Node memory is managed by this
 * simple library.
 * 
 * \warning Insertion of NULL element is discouraged, as it would not be possible to distinguish at peeking and dequeueing
 * if the element is NULL or if the queue is empty.
